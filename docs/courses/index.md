### 🔵 BFT Algorithm Learning Path

**Status:** ✅ Available  
**Level:** Intermediate to Advanced  
**Duration:** 10-15 hours (self-paced)

A comprehensive, progressive journey through Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithms, from foundational concepts to modern protocols like HotStuff 2.0.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Byzantine Generals Problem and why BFT matters
- Fault models: Crash vs. omission vs. Byzantine faults
- Safety & Liveness properties in consensus algorithms
- PBFT: The classic three-phase BFT protocol
- HotStuff 2.0: Modern BFT with linear communication complexity
