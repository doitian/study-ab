# Requirements Validation Checklist

## Feature: BFT Algorithm Learning Path

### Specification Quality Checks

- [x] **No Implementation Details**: Specification does not specify programming languages, frameworks, libraries, or APIs
- [x] **User-Focused**: All user stories describe value from the learner's perspective
- [x] **Technology-Agnostic**: Requirements focus on concepts and outcomes, not implementation choices
- [x] **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Each user story has concrete, testable acceptance scenarios
- [x] **No Ambiguity**: All requirements use clear, unambiguous language
- [x] **Measurable Success Criteria**: All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) are measurable and verifiable

### Completeness Checks

- [x] **User Stories Present**: 5 user stories covering the complete learning journey
- [x] **Priorities Assigned**: Each user story has a priority (P1-P4)
- [x] **Functional Requirements**: 15 functional requirements defined (FR-001 through FR-015)
- [x] **Success Criteria**: 8 measurable success criteria defined (SC-001 through SC-008)
- [x] **Edge Cases**: 5 edge cases identified and addressed
- [x] **Key Entities**: 7 key entities defined
- [x] **Assumptions Documented**: 5 assumptions clearly stated
- [x] **Scope Boundaries**: Out-of-scope items clearly defined

### Requirements Clarity

- [x] **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: All requirements are fully specified
- [x] **Progressive Structure**: Learning path follows logical progression from basic to advanced
- [x] **Independent User Stories**: Each user story can be tested independently
- [x] **HotStuff Article Integration**: Primary learning resource (decentralizedthoughts.github.io article) properly integrated

### Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade**: ✅ **PASS**

**Summary**: The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the planning phase. All user stories are well-defined with concrete acceptance scenarios, functional requirements are testable, and success criteria are measurable. No clarifications needed.

**Strengths**:
- Clear learning progression from fundamentals to advanced topics
- Well-integrated HotStuff 2.0 article as the primary resource
- Comprehensive coverage of BFT concepts (Byzantine Generals, PBFT, HotStuff)
- Technology-agnostic and implementation-independent
- Measurable success criteria for learning outcomes

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ Yes - Proceed to `/speckit.plan`
